Peacock is a QMK powered standalone 7" trackpad. The board features a macropad with 5 switches and 2 encoders and a completly custom designed trackpad. The two parts of the board are connected using ![a VIK interface](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/vik/blob/master/README.md) so the trackpad could also be used with different VIK compatible keyboards or controllers.
